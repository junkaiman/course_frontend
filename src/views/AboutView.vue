  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to course.gallinula.com! 
  <br />
  This is an internal platform for students at Duke Kunshan University to anonymously review courses and professors.
  <br /><br />
  <b>What courses should I assess? What to write about?</b>
  <br />
  For all courses, if you want to help (thanks!)
  <br />
  The best courses and teachers are those that have not been evaluated yet. Please don't be stingy with your reviews, and don't be afraid to say bad things about them.
  <br />
  Even courses that don't have much to offer are worth writing a review about, because "this class is normal" is an important message. A few words can save a lot of people from being lost.
  <br />
  The platform encourages everyone to write reviews in their own way, but an ideal review should
  <br />
  <b>Be factual.</b> "Class A is boring" is not a good review, "Class A teacher is a PPT Reader" is fine, "Class A teacher reads all the formulas on the PPT, word for word" is very good.
  <br />
  <b>Be comprehensive.</b> I have taken a class, the teacher's voice on the podium is small, speaking very nervous, but after the class to ask the paper, the teacher took me to the office, with a small blackboard to explain the paper all over again. Although this class is not necessarily good in the classroom, I have gained a lot from meeting this teacher in this class. The classroom, exams, assignments, and off-campus dimensions and stories are all covered and would be awesome.
  Also appropriate humor is best, but please respect the truth.

  <b>Is the content on the site moderated?</b>
  <br />
  On a full information basis, we do not review, edit, or evaluate the authenticity of the content on our website.
  This does not mean that we do not moderate the content at all. We do not want to create too many rules but the following are not accepted on our platform:
  <br/>
  Non-course evaluation information. (Please use your own discretion. There is a fundamental difference between saying "I have to say that the training program at the W School sucks" and "The W School is a piece of crap" in the full text.)
  <br/>
  Information that is disguised as a "course evaluation", but is in fact against the interests of others. For example: revealing unnecessary personal information ("Mr. xxx doesn't come to class, go to yyyy place zzzz"), slander unrelated to the content of the course ("Mr. xxx is always a drunk" is not acceptable, but "Mr. xxx is confused in class, comes late occasionally" is). For content that may involve the person in question violating laws and regulations, please avoid it if it is not related to the course, and if it is related to the course, we recommend reporting it to the public security authorities.
  <br/>
  Content that does not correspond to the facts and is reported by you/others and substantiated by evidence will be deleted, but we try not to use this article. If you think that other reviews are biased, you are welcome to submit your own reviews to refute them.
  <br/>
  In principle, we do not edit content, but only correct factual errors (misspelled teacher names, misfiled course names, semesters, etc.).

  <br /><br />
  <b> Disclaimer: </b>

  This is an unofficial platform, which is not affiliated with Duke Kunshan University.

  On a full information basis, we do not review, edit, or evaluate the content of course reviews on this site.
  If you have taken a course and believe that a review on this site is not factually correct, please submit your feedback to us.
